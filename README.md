# Fire-Severity-Compositing-code

This repository contains Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for generating Landsat-based fire severity composites. The methods and data processing techniques are detailed in the paper titled *"Optimising fire severity mapping using pixel-based image compositing."* It includes scripts for various compositing methods and exports related GeoJSON and TIFF data.

## Overview

The repository includes the necessary scripts to generate fire severity maps using various compositing techniques:

- **Initial summer-summer composite**: Used pre-fire imagery from the summer of the Year Before Fire (YBF) and post-fire imagery from the summer of the Year of Fire (YOF). The compositing criteria applied were max-min or mean-min.
- **Extended summer-summer composite**: Employed pre-fire imagery from the summer of the YBF and post-fire imagery from the summer of the Year After Fire (YAF). The compositing criterion applied was mean-mean.


These scripts allow the export of pixel centroids and TIFF imagery containing the following information:

- **Pre- and post-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)**
- **Near-Infrared (NIR) Band**
- **Short-Wave Infrared 2 (SWIR2) Band**
- **Pre- and post-fire Sensing Times**
- **Relativized Burned Ratio (RBR)**
- **Fire Year**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nataliaquintero/Fire-Severity-Compositing-code.git
   cd Fire-Severity-Compositing-code

2. #### Run the Scripts in Google Earth Engine:
Open the .js files in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) code editor.
Modify the study area, fire perimeters, and input parameters as needed.
Run the scripts to generate the fire severity composites and export the results to your Google Drive folder.
